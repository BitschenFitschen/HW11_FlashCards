# HW11_FlashCards

A Node.JS application that allows the user to either make a flashcard (basic and cloze) and then review said cards

or at least that was what the homework I believe was requesting

While I started making a completely different application initially, got confused a few times, nuked the whole thing before I turned it in.

Currently Working:
You will be prompted to either pick between Basic or Cloze
Then prompted to either "show the card" or "create a card"

When showing a card, it will display the question first and wait for response. If answered correctly = Yay!  If incorrectly = Nope!

I unfortunately did not get the 'make a card' section operational.
